LCA can comprehensively evaluate impacts across the entire life cycle---from `cradle to grave'--- often identifying critical hotspots and guiding prioritisation of action~\citep{guinee2011lca}. The standard approach is to apply Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods (such as ReCiPe~\citep{huijbregts2016recipe} and CML~\citep{guinee2002cml}), which convert the inventory data into a set of impact scores based on the sum of the elementary flows (those between the technosphere and biosphere). These scores can then be aggregated into one metric for each impact category that can be compared across products and processes. Extending on standard LCA is \textit{ex-ante} LCA, which employs future scenarios to construct `prospective background databases' to predict the impacts of supply chains that have not yet been (and may never be) realised~\citep{cucurachi2018exante,blanco2020exante}.

234a199
> Though often described simply as a `material with a negative economic value'~\citep{guinee2004economicallocation}, waste is a nebulous concept, and one whose definition is poorly delineated and highly variable across space and time. From a systems perspective, the notion of waste is anathema to the `circular economy', they cannot co-exist. From a practical economic viewpoint, the viability of an extensive waste processing system is highly dependent on precise knowledge (or at least, reasonable predictions) of material and waste flows, in addition to energy costs and the relative prices of virgin and secondary materials. Thus, as~\cite{bisinella2024wastelca} argues, waste must be `thoroughly characterised' and `modelling [of its management] must be physically based'. The reliable, robust models needed to guide the development of the circular economy can be built only on a foundation of high-quality data.

< The purpose of T-reX is not to quantify the environmental impacts of material
< consumption and waste production (the requisite data and impact modelling
< remain lacking), but rather to quantify the material and waste flows
< themselves, even those that are finally consumed by waste treatment processes.
< It provides, thus, not an impact assessment in the traditional sense, but an
< accounting of the material consumed and waste generated by a product or service
< inside of the technosphere, regardless of the end-of-life fate of these flows.
< By definition, the development of the `circular economy' necessitates the
< reduction and ultimate elimination of waste (though whether this objective is
< thermodynamically impossible has long been the subject of debate
< by~\cite{ayres1998recycling},~\cite{reuter2012recyclinglimits} and many

---
> Conventional LCA database models consider waste as a `service' (accounting for the treatment, not the material)~\citep{guinee2021wasteisnotaservice} and typically use generic waste processing models~\citep{beylot2018} that break the causal link between the functional unit and the waste-associated impacts. In LCA, waste flows are (almost exclusively) not considered as fundamental biosphere exchanges, but rather, as technosphere flows within the human economy. Waste produced by an activity is transferred to a relevant waste treatment activity where it is accepted `burden-free' and transformed into a combination of emissions and other waste `products'~\citep{guinee2021wasteisnotaservice}. There can be several treatment steps in this pathway leading, ultimately, to a mass of material being deposited in a landfill. In this system of waste accounting, the impacts apportioned to the waste-producing activity are a sum of those incurred by the transport, treatment, and final disposal of the waste into terrestrial or aquatic environments. In particular, the extensive work of~\cite{doka2024publications} has contributed significantly to understanding the environmental impacts of waste treatment processes and the modelling of the long-term impacts of disposal.

The environmental significance of waste and its correlation with other indicators has been the subject of extensive research. Studies have shown that popular resource footprints can cover a significant portion of environmental impact variance between activities~\citep{steinmann2017resourcefootprints,laurenti2023wastefootprint}. Correlations between various environmental indicators are not always consistent, however, as seen with the carbon footprint, which often does not correlate well with other impact assessment scores~\citep{laurenti2012carbonfootprint}. The aggregation of waste in PWFs raises concerns among LCA experts, regarding the uncertainties introduced, as well as the potential misrepresentation of environmental performance due to differences in waste types~\citep{chen2021methoduncertainty,huijbregts2010energyfootprint}.

< The Crustal Scarcity (CSI) LCIA method was developed in order to introduce an
< assessment of the long-term global scarcity of minerals in
< LCA~\citep{arvidsson2020csi}. The CSI introduced crustal scarcity potentials
< (CSPs), which are measured in kg–silicon–equivalents per kg–element and
< derived from crustal concentrations. CSPs, provided for 76 elements, reflect

> The purpose of T-reX is not to quantify the environmental impacts of material consumption and waste production (the requisite data and impact modelling remain lacking), but rather to quantify the material and waste flows themselves, even those that are finally consumed by waste treatment processes. It provides, thus, not an impact assessment in the traditional sense, but an accounting of the material consumed and waste generated by a product or service inside of the technosphere, regardless of the end-of-life fate of these flows. By definition, the development of the `circular economy' necessitates the reduction and ultimate elimination of waste (though whether this objective is thermodynamically impossible has long been the subject of debate by~\cite{ayres1998recycling},~\cite{reuter2012recyclinglimits} and many others). In any case, minimising primary material consumption and the generation of waste is of paramount importance. By allowing LCA practitioners to easily classify and quantify these exchanges, T-reX provides a practical means to identify hotspots and highlight opportunities for waste reduction and material efficiency.
358,362d227
< While useful for its intended purpose, the CSI presents its results in an

As the supply chains are expansive, this visualisation has been greatly simplified to be legible for print, multiple versions are included in the supplementary material in~\autoref{sec:supplementary-8}. As is evident in the figure, the largest contributors to the waste footprint are the extraction and processing of the raw materials, with the largest flows coming from the extraction of cobalt, lithium, and nickel. Due to the nature of LCA, the waste flows do not represent the `real' physical flows directly, but rather an abstraction thereof based on, in this case, economic allocation---the market price of the functional unit produced by the activity~\citep{guinee2004economicallocation}. If an unallocated database were available, the waste flows could be calculated with T-reX in the same way and would be more directly related to the physical flows of the activities.

< \autoref{fig:waste_totalANDcarbon} (a) shows the `total solid waste' inventory footprint for the five Li-ion batteries in the case study from 2020 to 2100 under the SSP2 scenario using the baseline and PkBudg500 RCPs of the REMIND model. The NMC811 battery has the largest footprint, producing over 50~kg of waste per kilogram of battery produced. The  LiMn\(_2\)O\(_4\) battery has the smallest footprint, producing less than 4~kg of waste per kilogram of battery. In each case, there was only a slight downward trend in the waste footprints between 2020 and 2100. This is mostly in the period between 2020 and 2040 and could be attributable to the relatively rapid decrease in fossil fuel use that is factored into the models over this time (since many produce relatively large amounts of waste during extraction and combustion). For the total waste generated by these batteries, there was very little difference observed between the baseline and PkBudg500 RCPs.
