        Minimising waste through the reuse of resources is the quintessential principle of the `circular economy', but relies on our ability to identify and quantify waste and material flows.
        Thus, identifying and quantifying waste and material flows are of fundamental importance. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is powerful for this end, given its capacity to pinpoint hotspots of environmental impact throughout the life cycle of products and services, those where the implementation of circular principles could be most effective.

        Introducing T-reX, a Python tool extending the Brightway framework for flexible quantification of user-defined supply-chain demands in current and future scenarios. This tool streamlines database manipulation for LCA practitioners and integrates methods to aggregate and analyse waste and material flows, facilitating rapid hotspot identification.

        A case study on battery supply chains demonstrates the tool's utility. T-reX quantifies and compares inventory demands and, thus, potential environmental burdens, aiding sustainable decision-making. It contributes to the development of the `circular economy' by providing detailed material usage and waste generation analysis.

\cbox{Section word count: 250}
We have written the T-reX tool, an extension to the brightway2 LCA framework that enables the user to calculate the waste and material footprints of a product or service in an LCA database. It explodes the database, identifies upstream waste and material exchanges, edits them, and writes matching custom WMF methods. These exchanges become pseudo-biosphere flows and thus, the footprint can be calculated as with the existing LCIA methods. The WMF tool can be easily customised by the user to calculate the footprints of other supply-chain flows such as water, gas, and critical raw materials.

This paper extends the state of knowledge by exploring the relationship between various waste aggregation methods and environmental damage indicators, contributing to a deeper understanding of life cycle waste inventories and their association with supply-chain risk and potential environmental damage.
